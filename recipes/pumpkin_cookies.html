  <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li> 
  <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
  <li>½ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
  <li>½ teaspoon ground ginger</li>
  <li>1 cup unsalted butter, softened</li> 
  <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
  <li>¾ cup brown sugar</li>
  <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
  <li>1 large egg</li>
  <li>1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree</li>

<h5>Frosting:</h5>
<ul>
  <li>1 (3 ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>
  <li>¼ cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
  <li>2 cups powdered sugar</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). 
    Lightly grease two baking sheets.</li>
  <li>Make cookies: Whisk flour, baking powder, cinnamon, 
    baking soda, nutmeg, and ginger together in a bowl.</li>
  <li>Beat butter, both sugars, egg, and vanilla with an 
    electric mixer in a separate large bowl until smooth. 
    Beat in pumpkin puree. Gradually stir dry ingredients 
    into pumpkin mixture until combined; batter will be moist.</li>
  <li>Drop teaspoonfuls of batter about 2 inches apart onto 
    the prepared baking sheets.</li>
  <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cookies are lightly browned,
    10 to 12 minutes, switching racks halfway through.</li>
  <li>Remove from the oven and let cool on the sheets for 5 minutes.
    Transfer cookies to a wire rack and cool completely, about 25 minutes.</li>
  <li>While the cookies are cooling, make frosting: Beat cream cheese,
    butter, and vanilla in a bowl with an electric mixer until soft and 
    creamy. Beat in powdered sugar, about 1/2 cup at a time, until frosting
    is smooth and spreadable.</li>
  <li>Spread frosting over cooled cookies.</li>
